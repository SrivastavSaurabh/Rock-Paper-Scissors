# Rock-Paper-Scissors

Rock-Paper-Scissors Game  

This project is a simple **Rock-Paper-Scissors** game built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. The user selects one of the three options (rock, paper, or scissors), and the computer randomly generates its choice. The game then determines the winner based on standard rules:    

- Rock beats Scissors  
- Scissors beat Paper   
- Paper beats Rock  

The scoreboard keeps track of the user's and computer's wins, and a message displays the game result. The project utilizes **DOM manipulation, event listeners, and randomization** to create an interactive experience.
